# Additional requirements for Voice and Video features
# Install these in addition to your existing requirements

# Voice Processing Dependencies
speechrecognition==3.10.0    # Speech-to-text functionality
pyttsx3==2.90                 # Text-to-speech synthesis
pyaudio==0.2.11               # Audio I/O for real-time voice processing
wave==0.0.2                   # Audio file processing

# Video Processing Dependencies
opencv-python==4.8.1.78       # Computer vision and video processing
numpy==1.24.3                 # Required by OpenCV (may already be installed)
Pillow==10.0.1                # Image processing (may already be installed)

# Facial Expression Recognition (Optional but recommended)
fer==22.5.1                   # Facial emotion recognition library
tensorflow==2.13.0            # Required by FER (warning: large download)

# Advanced Face Detection (Optional)
dlib==19.24.2                 # Advanced face detection and recognition
cmake==3.27.6                 # Required to compile dlib

# Alternative lightweight options if you prefer to avoid tensorflow:
# mediapipe==0.10.7           # Google's MediaPipe for face detection
# face-recognition==1.3.0     # Simple face recognition library

# Audio Processing Enhancements (Optional)
# librosa==0.10.1             # Advanced audio analysis
# soundfile==0.12.1           # Audio file I/O

# Installation Notes:
# 1. Install PyAudio first (may require system-level audio libraries)
# 2. For dlib on Windows: pip install cmake first, then dlib
# 3. TensorFlow is large (~500MB) - only install if you want advanced emotion recognition
# 4. If you encounter issues with any package, try the alternatives listed above

# Platform-specific notes:
# Windows: You may need Microsoft C++ Build Tools for some packages
# macOS: brew install portaudio (for PyAudio)
# Linux: sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-dev (for PyAudio)
